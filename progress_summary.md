- **Model Provider Abstraction**: Created a unified interface for different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) with intelligent routing and cost control.
- **Multi-Query Expansion**: Implemented query decomposition, LLM-based reformulation, and domain-specific query expansion techniques.

### Phase 2: RAG Technique Enhancements (COMPLETED)
- **Self-RAG Improvements**: Implemented retrieval verification, citation framework, confidence scoring, feedback loops, and answer revision.

  - Created client libraries for streaming support
  - Built demo applications showcasing streaming RAG

## Current Progress Summary

We have successfully completed all of Phase 1 (Core Architecture) and Phase 2 (RAG Technique Enhancements). The implementation now includes a comprehensive set of advanced RAG techniques, including:

1. **Self-RAG** with verification and citation framework
2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** with transparent step-by-step thinking
3. **Hypothetical Document Embeddings** with multi-perspective generation
4. **Multi-Hop RAG** with graph-based knowledge representation
5. **Multi-Modal RAG** with vision-language integration
6. **Streaming RAG** with progressive retrieval and client libraries

These implementations provide RAGNITE with sophisticated capabilities for handling complex queries, bridging semantic gaps between queries and documents, and providing transparent reasoning processes. The system can now handle multi-modal content, perform multi-hop reasoning, and deliver streaming responses with progressive retrieval.

## Next Steps

According to the NEXT_STEPS_2.md document, the next phase to implement is Phase 3: Performance Optimization, focusing on:

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Caching Infrastructure** (Section 3.1):
   - Implement embedding cache
   - Create semantic cache for similar queries
   - Add result cache with time-based invalidation
   - Implement prompt template caching
   - Create cache monitoring dashboard
   - Add cache performance analytics

2. **Vector Database Optimization** (Section 3.2):
   - Implement HNSW index optimization
   - Add IVF index support
   - Create auto-sharding for large knowledge bases
   - Implement metadata filtering
   - Build index monitoring tools
   - Add query latency tracking

3. **Batch Processing** (Section 3.3):
   - Implement parallel query processing
   - Create asynchronous retrieval pipeline
   - Add batch embedding generation
   - Support OpenAI's batch API with discount
   - Implement job queuing system
   - Create batch processing dashboard

### Medium-Term Priorities:
4. **Production Readiness** (Phase 4):
   - Monitoring and Analytics
   - Error Handling and Resilience
   - Documentation and Examples
   - Evaluation Framework

### Long-Term Priorities:
5. **Domain Specialization** (Phase 5):
   - Code RAG Improvements
   - Industry Vertical Support
   - RAG for Structured Data

## Recommendation

Based on the current state of the project and planned features, we recommend focusing next on the **Caching Infrastructure** implementation, as this would provide immediate performance benefits and help reduce costs by minimizing redundant API calls and computation.

After Caching Infrastructure, implementing **Vector Database Optimization** would further enhance performance, especially for large-scale knowledge bases.

These performance optimizations would position RAGNITE as not only feature-rich but also efficient and scalable for production use cases.
