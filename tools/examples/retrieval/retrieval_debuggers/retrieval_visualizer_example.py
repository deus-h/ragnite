            Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and search vector embeddings efficiently. Unlike traditional databases that excel at exact matching, vector databases are optimized for similarity search in high-dimensional spaces, making them ideal for machine learning applications including RAG systems.
            
            The core capability of these databases is approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, which finds the most similar vectors to a query vector without exhaustively comparing against every vector in the database. This is achieved through specialized indexing structures like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), IVF (Inverted File Index), or PQ (Product Quantization).
