# Scientific RAG

## Overview
Scientific RAG is a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation system designed to enhance AI-assisted scientific research and knowledge exploration. This implementation incorporates domain-specific chunking, retrieval strategies, and evaluation metrics tailored for scientific literature, research papers, and technical data.

## Features

### 1. Scientific Literature Processing
- **Paper Structure Awareness**: Intelligent chunking that respects the structure of scientific papers (abstract, methods, results, discussion, etc.)
- **Formula & Equation Handling**: Special processing for mathematical formulas, equations, and notations
- **Citation & Reference Management**: Tracking of citations and references between documents
- **Figure & Table Extraction**: Specialized handling of visual information and tabular data

### 2. Scientific Knowledge Retrieval
- **Citation-Aware Retrieval**: Retrieval algorithms that consider citation networks and academic impact
- **Semantic Field Recognition**: Enhanced understanding of scientific terms and their relationships
- **Cross-Disciplinary Connections**: Ability to retrieve relevant information across different scientific domains
- **Temporal Research Trends**: Consideration of publication dates and research evolution

### 3. Scientific QA & Generation
- **Evidence-Based Responses**: Generation of answers backed by specific scientific sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Indication of confidence levels for scientific claims
- **Research Gap Identification**: Highlighting of areas with limited or conflicting evidence
- **Methodology Suggestions**: Providing research methodology recommendations
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Assistance in formulating research hypotheses based on retrieved literature

### 4. Scientific Validity & Verification
- **Claim Verification**: Checking generated claims against retrieved scientific literature
- **Source Quality Assessment**: Evaluation of source credibility (journal impact, citation count)
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Clear indication of speculative vs. established knowledge
- **Conflict Identification**: Highlighting of conflicting evidence in the literature

## Use Cases

### 1. Literature Review Assistance
- Automated summarization of relevant literature for a research question
- Identification of key papers, authors, and trends in a field
- Extraction of methodologies used across multiple studies

### 2. Research Design Support
- Suggesting experimental methods based on similar research
- Identifying variables and parameters from related studies
- Highlighting potential confounding factors based on literature

### 3. Data Analysis Assistance
- Recommending statistical approaches based on research context
- Providing interpretations of results based on similar studies
- Suggesting visualizations and reporting standards

### 4. Interdisciplinary Connections
- Finding connections between different scientific fields
- Identifying techniques or findings that could transfer between domains
- Discovering potential collaborations across disciplines

## Implementation Details

### Document Processing
- Custom chunking strategies for scientific papers that preserve logical sections
- Special handling for mathematical notation, figures, tables, and references
- Metadata extraction for publication details, authors, and affiliations

### Embedding & Retrieval
- Domain-adapted scientific embeddings that capture technical terminology
- Citation-aware retrieval that considers academic relationships between papers
- Re-ranking based on publication recency, citation count, and source quality

### Prompting & Generation
- Specialized prompt templates for different scientific tasks
- Structured output formats for hypotheses, methods, and findings
- Citation and evidence tracking in generated text

### Evaluation Metrics
- Scientific accuracy assessment
- Source quality and diversity measurement
- Citation and evidence verification
- Research utility and actionability metrics

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
cd domain-specific/scientific-rag
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage Example
```python
from scientific_rag import ScientificRAG

# Initialize the system
rag = ScientificRAG()

# Ingest scientific papers
rag.ingest_documents('path/to/papers/')

# Query the system
response = rag.query("What are the current approaches to quantum error correction?")

# Display the response with citations
print(response.answer)
for source in response.sources:
    print(f"- {source.title} ({source.authors}, {source.year})")
```
