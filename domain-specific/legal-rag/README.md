# Legal RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Legal Research

## Overview
This folder contains a specialized RAG implementation tailored for legal research, case analysis, and legal document processing. Legal RAG is designed to handle legal statutes, case law, contracts, and legal queries, providing accurate and contextually relevant responses while maintaining legal precision.

## What is Legal RAG?
Legal RAG adapts the general RAG framework to the unique challenges of legal information:

1. **Legal Text Chunking**: Intelligently splits legal documents based on logical sections (statutes, provisions, precedents, etc.) rather than arbitrary token counts
2. **Legal-Specific Embeddings**: Uses embeddings optimized for legal terminology and concepts
3. **Hierarchical Retrieval**: Implements retrieval strategies that consider legal hierarchies and jurisdictional relevance
4. **Citation-Aware Processing**: Recognizes, preserves, and leverages legal citations during chunking and retrieval
5. **Legal-Aware Prompting**: Crafts prompts that instruct the LLM to generate accurate, precise, and legally sound responses
6. **Legal Authority Verification**: Applies mechanisms to verify legal claims against authoritative sources

## Use Cases
Legal RAG can assist with a variety of legal tasks:

- **Legal Research**: Find relevant statutes, regulations, and case law
- **Case Analysis**: Retrieve similar cases and relevant precedents
- **Contract Review**: Extract and analyze contractual provisions
- **Legal Summarization**: Summarize complex legal documents and cases
- **Compliance Checking**: Assess document compliance with specific regulations
- **Legal QA**: Answer legal questions with citations to appropriate authority

## Implementation Details
Our implementation uses:
- **Legal Text Chunking**: Section-aware chunking optimized for legal documents
- **Legal Embeddings**: Fine-tuned embeddings for legal text
- **Vector Database**: FAISS with specialized indexing for legal terminology
- **LLM**: GPT-3.5-turbo with legal-specific prompting
- **Citation Handling**: Extraction and preservation of legal citations
- **Authority Verification**: Cross-reference with authoritative legal sources

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Index legal documents:
   ```
   python src/legal_indexer.py --doc_dir path/to/legal/docs
   ```

4. Run a query through the Legal RAG pipeline:
   ```
   python src/legal_rag_pipeline.py --query "What are the elements of negligence under common law?"
   ```

## Example
```python
from legal_rag_pipeline import LegalRAG

# Initialize the Legal RAG pipeline
legal_rag = LegalRAG(
    vector_store_path="data/processed/legal_vector_store",
    verify_authority=True
)

# Query the Legal RAG system
response = legal_rag.query("What is the standard for summary judgment in federal courts?")
print(response)

# Check citations and confidence scores
for citation in response["citations"]:
    print(f"Citation: {citation['text']} - Source: {citation['source']}")
print(f"Confidence Score: {response['confidence_score']}")
```

## Special Features

### Legal Citation Recognition
Legal RAG integrates citation recognition to:
- Identify legal citations (cases, statutes, regulations)
- Parse citation components (parties, reporter, court, year)
- Standardize citations across different formats
- Enhance retrieval by focusing on cited legal authorities

### Jurisdiction Awareness
Responses include:
- Recognition of jurisdictional boundaries
- Identification of controlling vs. persuasive authority
- Citation to primary legal authorities appropriate to jurisdiction
- Clear indication of jurisdictional limitations

### Ethical Considerations
Legal RAG implements safeguards for:
- Clearly distinguishing between established law and legal opinion
- Indicating when information might not be comprehensive enough for legal decisions
- Maintaining client confidentiality when handling legal documents
- Including appropriate disclaimers about not constituting legal advice

## Limitations
- Not a replacement for professional legal advice or legal research
- Limited to information in the indexed knowledge base
- May not reflect the most recent legal developments unless regularly updated
- Performance varies across jurisdictions and legal specialties
- Responses should be verified by qualified legal professionals
