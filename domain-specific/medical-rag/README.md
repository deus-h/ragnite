# Medical RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Healthcare

## Overview
This folder contains a specialized RAG implementation tailored for healthcare and medical applications. Medical RAG is designed to handle medical literature, clinical notes, and health-related queries, providing accurate and contextually relevant responses while maintaining ethical standards.

## What is Medical RAG?
Medical RAG adapts the general RAG framework to the unique challenges of healthcare information:

1. **Medical Text Chunking**: Intelligently splits medical documents based on logical sections (abstracts, methods, results, etc.) rather than arbitrary token counts
2. **Medical-Specific Embeddings**: Uses embeddings optimized for biomedical and clinical text
3. **Context-Sensitive Retrieval**: Implements retrieval strategies that consider medical terminology and semantic relationships
4. **Medical-Aware Prompting**: Crafts prompts that instruct the LLM to generate accurate, evidence-based, and ethically sound responses
5. **Medical Fact Verification**: Applies mechanisms to verify medical claims against authoritative sources

## Use Cases
Medical RAG can assist with a variety of healthcare tasks:

- **Medical Literature Search**: Find relevant research papers and clinical guidelines
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Retrieve information to assist with diagnostic and treatment decisions
- **Patient Education**: Generate accurate health information for patient education
- **Medical Summarization**: Summarize complex medical documents into digestible information
- **Drug Information Retrieval**: Find information about medications, interactions, and side effects
- **Medical QA**: Answer medical and health-related questions with citations to reliable sources

## Implementation Details
Our implementation uses:
- **Medical Text Chunking**: Section-aware chunking optimized for medical literature and clinical notes
- **Medical Embeddings**: PubMedBERT or BioBERT fine-tuned for biomedical text
- **Vector Database**: FAISS with specialized indexing for medical terminology
- **LLM**: GPT-3.5-turbo with medical-specific prompting
- **Fact Verification**: Cross-reference with authoritative medical sources

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Index medical documents:
   ```
   python src/medical_indexer.py --doc_dir path/to/medical/docs
   ```

4. Run a query through the Medical RAG pipeline:
   ```
   python src/medical_rag_pipeline.py --query "What are the symptoms of type 2 diabetes?"
   ```

## Example
```python
from medical_rag_pipeline import MedicalRAG

# Initialize the Medical RAG pipeline
medical_rag = MedicalRAG(
    vector_store_path="data/processed/medical_vector_store",
    verify_facts=True
)

# Query the Medical RAG system
response = medical_rag.query("What are the recommended treatments for hypertension?")
print(response)

# Check citations and confidence scores
for citation in response["citations"]:
    print(f"Citation: {citation['text']} - Source: {citation['source']}")
print(f"Confidence Score: {response['confidence_score']}")
```

## Special Features

### Medical Entity Recognition
Medical RAG integrates medical entity recognition to:
- Identify medical terms, conditions, medications, and procedures
- Link entities to standard medical ontologies (UMLS, SNOMED CT, RxNorm)
- Enhance retrieval by focusing on key medical concepts

### Evidence Levels & Citation
Responses include:
- Level of evidence classification (from systematic reviews to expert opinions)
- Citations to primary medical literature or clinical guidelines
- Confidence scores based on the quality of supporting evidence

### Ethical Considerations
Medical RAG implements safeguards for:
- Clearly distinguishing between established medical facts and emerging research
- Indicating when information might not be comprehensive enough for clinical decisions
- Maintaining patient privacy when handling clinical data
- Avoiding harmful or dangerous medical advice

## Limitations
- Not a replacement for professional medical advice or diagnosis
- Limited to information in the indexed knowledge base
- May not reflect the most recent medical research unless regularly updated
- Performance varies across medical specialties and rare conditions
- Responses should be verified by qualified healthcare professionals
